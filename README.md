### Acknowledgment

I would like to acknowledge the assistance provided by OpenAI's ChatGPT in completing my homework assignment for BMI 500 Week 13. The insights and guidance offered by ChatGPT significantly aided in understanding and solving various aspects of the assignment, particularly in the areas of code development and conceptual explanations. I have thoroughly reviewed and understood all contributions made by ChatGPT and have ensured that they align with the academic integrity standards of the course.
